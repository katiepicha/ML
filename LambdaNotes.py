LAMBDA FUNCTIONS

- Lambda keyword is used to declare an anonymous function
    - anonymous function = a function declared with no name
- lambda functions behave in the same way as regular functions that are declared using the def keyword

- good for a short period of time or quick use

CONCLUSION
- single-line function declared with no name, which can have any number of arguments, but it can only have one expression
- often times a lambda function is passed as an argument to another function
